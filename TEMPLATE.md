# Template: Mobile

An installable phone app. Zero dependencies, so it boots with no `npm install`.
It is a shell to build ON, not a placeholder to delete.

## What's already built and wired (do NOT rebuild it)

```
server.js          zero-dep HTTP server: static files + JSON API + /health
lib/store.js       durable JSON storage, atomic writes (temp file + rename)
public/index.html  app bar + 3 tab screens + bottom tab bar
public/styles.css  design tokens — edit :root, don't re-invent a palette
public/app.js      tab switching, install prompt, service worker registration
public/sw.js       offline fallback ONLY (read the warning below)
```

- **This app installs to the home screen, and you do NOT wire that up.** The
  platform injects the manifest, the app icon, `theme-color` and the
  `apple-mobile-web-app-*` tags at the proxy, built from this app's real name
  with its own generated icon. **Never add a `<link rel="manifest">` or a
  `manifest.json`**: the platform steps aside the moment a page declares one,
  so a static manifest would replace the user's real app name and icon with a
  hardcoded placeholder on every install. Renaming the app is enough; the
  home-screen label follows automatically.
- **NEVER make the service worker cache CSS, JS or API responses.** This app is
  redeployed on every change, and a caching worker would serve the old build to
  a user who just asked for a new one. `public/sw.js` is deliberately
  network-first with a single offline fallback. Leave it that way.
- **Add screens as `<section class="screen">` plus a `.tab` button** with a
  matching `data-screen`. `app.js` wires them automatically, there is no router
  to touch. Three tabs is a starting point, not a rule: rename them to whatever
  the app is actually about.
- **Keep navigation in the bottom tab bar.** It is thumb-reachable, which is why
  phone apps put it there. Don't replace it with a hamburger or a top nav.
- **No dependencies, no `npm install`.** Keep it that way unless the app
  genuinely needs a package; every dependency costs the user an install on every
  build.
- **Add API routes to the `routes` table in `server.js`** (`'GET /api/items'`).
  There is a worked example in the comment above it.
- **Persist with `lib/store.js`**, don't hand-roll `fs.writeFileSync` — a
  non-atomic write corrupts the user's data when a container restarts mid-write.
- `/health` exists and the platform uses it. Don't remove it.

## Built for the home screen

People use this app from an icon on their phone, not a browser tab. That
changes three things:

- **There is no browser back button.** Installed, the app opens full screen
  with no browser bar at all, so every screen you add needs its own way back
  (a tab, a back arrow in the app bar, a close button on a sheet). A screen
  with no exit is a dead end on a real phone.
- **The platform shows the install hint, not you.** On an iPhone the platform
  puts an "Add to your home screen" banner over the page and explains
  Share, then Add to Home Screen. Do not build your own install banner,
  modal or instructions; the Install card in `index.html` only serves
  Android's real install prompt.
- **Say how to install it ONCE, at the first build.** One line in your reply:
  open the link in Safari, tap Share, then Add to Home Screen. After that,
  only if they ask.

## Where things go

| Adding | Put it in |
|---|---|
| A screen | a `<section class="screen">` + a `.tab` button in `public/index.html` |
| An API endpoint | the `routes` table in `server.js` |
| Saved data | `lib/store.js` via `store.read` / `store.write` |
| Styling | `public/styles.css` (tokens first) |
| The app's name/icon | nothing to edit — the platform derives both from the app's name |
| Shared logic | a new file in `lib/` |

## Safe areas

`index.html` ships `viewport-fit=cover` and the CSS pads with
`env(safe-area-inset-*)`. Any new fixed-position element must respect those
insets or it will sit under the notch or the home indicator on a real phone.
